# COVID
An app developed with React Native that displays statistics about the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

I built the app to share data and learn the basic ins and outs of React Native.


To get it running on your phone, [download the expo app](https://expo.io) for your platform and [visit the expo site for this project](https://expo.io/@aritzcovan/COVIDTracker) to get the latest version of the app.

please email me @ aritzcovan@gmail.com with any feedback or issues.

Thanks
