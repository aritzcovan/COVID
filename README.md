# COVID

An app developed with React Native that displays statistics about the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

I built the app to share data and learn the basic ins and outs of React Native.

This app runs on BOTH Android and Ios.

To get it running on your phone, [download the expo app](https://expo.io) for your platform and [visit the expo site for this project](https://expo.io/@aritzcovan/COVIDTracker) to get the latest version of the app.
